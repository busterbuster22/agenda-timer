# GREENS MEETING TIMER - PROJECT SUMMARY

## What You've Got

I've created a complete, working Google Meet Add-on for managing your Greens meetings. Here's what it does:

### For Everyone in the Meeting (Main Stage Display)
- **Agenda List**: Shows all agenda items with their durations
- **Current Item Timer**: Large countdown timer for the active agenda item
- **Speaker Timer**: Separate timer that counts up when someone is speaking
- **Visual Feedback**: 
  - Active items are highlighted in blue
  - Completed items are greyed out and crossed through
  - Timers turn yellow at warning time, red when time's up
  - Smooth animations and professional design

### For the Facilitator (Side Panel)
- **Add Agenda Items**: Quick form to add items with names and durations
- **Manage Items**: Select, remove, or navigate through agenda items
- **Timer Controls**: Independent start/pause/stop for both timers
- **Next Item Button**: Marks current item done and moves to next
- **Persistent Storage**: Agenda items saved locally (survives refresh)

## Technical Details

**Built With:**
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling (responsive, professional design)
- JavaScript (vanilla - no frameworks needed)
- Google Meet Add-ons SDK v1.1.0

**Architecture:**
- Side Panel: Facilitator control interface
- Main Stage: Shared display visible to all participants
- Real-time state synchronisation between panels
- Local storage for agenda persistence

**Files Included:**
1. `sidepanel.html` - Facilitator interface markup
2. `sidepanel.js` - Control logic and state management
3. `mainstage.html` - Participant display markup
4. `mainstage.js` - Display logic and state updates
5. `styles.css` - All styling (both interfaces)
6. `package.json` - Node.js dependencies
7. `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation
8. `QUICK-START.md` - Step-by-step setup checklist
9. `ICON-INSTRUCTIONS.txt` - How to add an icon

## Key Features Implemented

✅ All participants see agenda and timers
✅ Agenda timer counts DOWN (e.g., 5:00 → 0:00)
✅ Speaker timer counts UP (e.g., 0:00 → 3:25)
✅ Facilitator controls both timers independently
✅ Start/pause/stop functionality for both timers
✅ Navigate through agenda items (next/previous)
✅ Visual warnings (yellow at 1 min, red at 0 for agenda)
✅ Visual warnings for long speakers (yellow at 3min, red at 5min)
✅ Mark items as complete
✅ Add/remove agenda items on the fly
✅ Professional, accessible design
✅ Responsive (works on different screen sizes)

## What You Need to Do Next

### Immediate Steps:
1. **Install Node.js** (if you haven't already)
2. **Create Google Cloud Project** and get your project number
3. **Update the code** with your project number (2 places)
4. **Deploy to a public URL** (Netlify is easiest)
5. **Register the add-on** in Google Cloud Console
6. **Install and test** in a Google Meet call

### Follow Either:
- **QUICK-START.md** for a checkbox-style guide
- **README.md** for detailed explanations

## What's NOT Included (Future Enhancements)

These would be good next features but aren't in the MVP:
- Agenda templates (save/load common agendas)
- Meeting notes/minutes
- Export functionality
- Audio alerts when time's up
- Participant list tracking
- Vote/poll functionality
- Multiple timer presets
- Integration with Google Calendar

## Estimated Setup Time

- If you're familiar with web hosting: **30-60 minutes**
- If this is your first time: **1-2 hours**
- Most time is spent waiting for Google Cloud setup/approval

## Getting Help

**Documentation:**
- Full README.md in the project folder
- Google's official docs: https://developers.google.com/meet/add-ons

**Common Issues:**
- Make sure you enable the SDK, not the API
- Project number is JUST numbers, no other characters
- URLs must be publicly accessible (not localhost)
- Allow 5-10 minutes after installing for add-on to appear
