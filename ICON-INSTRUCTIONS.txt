ICON REQUIREMENTS FOR GOOGLE MEET ADD-ON

You need to create an icon.png file (128x128 pixels) for your add-on.

OPTION 1: Use an online tool
- Go to https://www.canva.com/ (free)
- Create a 128x128px design
- Add a clock/timer icon or text
- Download as PNG named "icon.png"
- Put it in this folder

OPTION 2: Use a simple icon
- Find a free icon at https://www.flaticon.com/
- Search for "timer" or "clock"
- Download as 128x128 PNG
- Rename to "icon.png"
- Put it in this folder

OPTION 3: Create one yourself
- Use any image editor
- 128 x 128 pixels
- Simple design (looks good when small)
- Save as icon.png

Once you have icon.png in this folder, update the deployment JSON 
in Google Cloud Console to point to:
https://YOUR-DEPLOYED-URL/icon.png
